## PvS Control Engine

In this repo we maintain the source code of the PvS control engine. For a functional and ready-to-use build, please consider using the code contained in the pvs-build/ folder.

We also provide an example of a functional control plane app for running on top of ONOS, that interacts with the l2 virtual switch (supporting packet-in, flowrule write and packet-out). For the source code and deployment instructions, please refer to the pvs-onos/ folder.
